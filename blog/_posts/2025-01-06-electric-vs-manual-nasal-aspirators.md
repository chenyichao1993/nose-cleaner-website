The main decision comes down to electric vs manual models, each with distinct advantages and considerations. This comprehensive comparison will help you make an informed choice for your family's needs.

## Understanding Nasal Aspirators

### What Are Nasal Aspirators?

Nasal aspirators are devices designed to remove mucus from a baby's nasal passages, helping them breathe more easily. They work by creating suction to draw out congestion, making feeding and sleeping more comfortable for your little one.
